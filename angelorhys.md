### Most Interesting Code and Most Proud Of
The framework for the NPC AI. From the begninning I wanted to make this paer of the project as easy to extend as possible, to allow us to implement relatively elaborate behaviors simply. This piece of code make good use of scriptable objects to implement a strategy pattern that allows behaviors to be plugged in and swapped out quickly.
